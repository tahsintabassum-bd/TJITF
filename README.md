# Transportation Justice Threshold Index Framework (TJTIF)
This project applied the Transportation Justice Threshold Index Framework (TJTIF) to analyze transportation equity across 20 municipalities in Oklahoma County. Using RStudio, the study integrated CSV data of transportation justice (TJ) variables with geospatial shapefiles to generate a detailed study area map. The Average Regional Threshold (ART) was calculated as a benchmark for each variable, representing the average value for municipalities in the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area. A relative graduated scale, ranging from -3 to 3, was developed to assess the degree of need for each variable, with values above or below the ART indicating areas of higher need. The threshold index values were calculated for each variable and aggregated into a composite index value for each region. A positive composite value identified a Transportation Justice (TJ) area, while a negative value indicated a non-TJ area. Areas with a composite value of zero were flagged for further investigation.escription here
